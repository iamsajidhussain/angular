## üéØ Angular Fundamentals
## 1. What is _Angular_ and what are its key features?  
**Answer:**  
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building single-page web applications (SPAs). It is maintained by Google and offers a powerful ecosystem for developing dynamic and scalable applications.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Two-way Data Binding**: Synchronizes data between the model and the view.  
2. **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies service management and reusability.  
3. **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular and reusable building blocks.  
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behavior.  
5. **RxJS**: Handles asynchronous operations using reactive programming.  
6. **Routing**: Manages navigation between different views.  
7. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Improves performance by pre-compiling HTML and TypeScript.  

**Summary:**  
Angular is a TypeScript-based framework with features like data binding, dependency injection, components, directives, and reactive programming for scalable SPAs.
