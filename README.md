**Key Features:**  
1. **Two-way Data Binding**: Synchronizes data between the model and the view.  
2. **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies service management and reusability.  
3. **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular and reusable building blocks.  
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behavior.  
5. **RxJS**: Handles asynchronous operations using reactive programming.  
6. **Routing**: Manages navigation between different views.  
7. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Improves performance by pre-compiling HTML and TypeScript.  

**Summary:**  
Angular is a TypeScript-based framework with features like data binding, dependency injection, components, directives, and reactive programming for scalable SPAs.
<br>

## 2. Explain _data-binding_ in _Angular_. What are the different types?
Data binding in Angular allows synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI). It ensures that changes in data reflect automatically in the UI and vice versa.  

**Types of Data Binding in Angular:**

1. **Interpolation (One-way binding)**:  
   `{{ expression }}`  
   Binds data from the component to the view. Used to display values in HTML.

2. **Property Binding (One-way binding)**:  
   `[property]="expression"`  
   Binds component properties to HTML element properties.

3. **Event Binding (One-way binding)**:  
   `(event)="handler"`  
   Binds events like clicks or keypresses to methods in the component.

4. **Two-Way Binding**:  
   `[(ngModel)]="property"`  
   Combines property and event binding, allowing changes in the UI to update the model and vice versa.  

**Summary:**  
Data binding in Angular synchronizes data between the component and view. It includes interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding for dynamic UI updates.
<br>

## 3. Describe the Angular application architecture.  
The architecture of an Angular project is organized into several key files and folders, each serving a specific purpose to structure and manage your application effectively. Below is a detailed explanation of the typical Angular project architecture, along with the uses of each file and folder.

### 1. **src/app** - The Core Application Folder
   - **Purpose**: Contains the main logic of your application, including components, services, and modules.
   
   #### Key files and folders inside `app`:
   
   - **app.component.ts**: The root component of your application. It usually contains the main layout and is the entry point for your application's component tree.
   - **app.module.ts**: The root module that declares and bootstraps the root component (`AppComponent`). It also imports other feature modules and third-party modules.
   - **app-routing.module.ts**: Defines the routing configuration for your app. It maps URLs to components, so the right component is displayed when a user navigates to a certain route.

   #### Folder Structure:
   
   - **components/**: Contains all Angular components for your app. A component consists of a TypeScript file for logic, an HTML file for the template, and a CSS file for styling.
     - **Example**: `header.component.ts`, `footer.component.ts`
   
   - **services/**: Contains all your Angular services. Services are used for logic that needs to be shared across components (e.g., API calls, data manipulation, etc.). They are typically injected into components via Angular's dependency injection system.
     - **Example**: `auth.service.ts`, `user.service.ts`
   
   - **models/**: Stores TypeScript interfaces or classes that define data structures for your app.
     - **Example**: `user.model.ts`, `post.model.ts`
   
   - **pipes/**: Contains custom pipes that transform data in templates (e.g., formatting dates, capitalizing text).
     - **Example**: `date-format.pipe.ts`
   
   - **directives/**: Contains custom directives that modify the behavior of DOM elements.
     - **Example**: `highlight.directive.ts`

### 2. **src/assets** - Static Assets
   - **Purpose**: Contains static files like images, fonts, and other assets used by the application.
   - **Example**: Images, CSS files, etc.
     - `src/assets/logo.png`

### 3. **src/environments** - Environment Settings
   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, production). It allows you to easily switch settings for different environments.
   
   #### Files inside:
   - **environment.ts**: Configurations for the development environment.
   - **environment.prod.ts**: Configurations for the production environment (e.g., production API URLs).
   
   These files can include variables like API endpoints, feature flags, etc.

### 4. **e2e** - End-to-End Tests
   - **Purpose**: Contains tests that verify the complete functionality of your application, simulating user interaction and checking if everything works as expected in a real browser.
   - **Files**:
     - **src/app.e2e-spec.ts**: Defines end-to-end tests for the application. It uses a framework like Protractor (or another testing library) to run the tests in the browser.

### 5. **node_modules** - Dependencies
   - **Purpose**: Contains all the third-party libraries and dependencies your project requires, such as Angular itself, RxJS, and other libraries you install via `npm`.
   
   You don't need to modify files here, as this folder is automatically managed by the package manager.

### 6. **src/index.html** - The Main HTML Template
   - **Purpose**: The root HTML file for the Angular application. This is where Angular bootstraps the app by adding the `<app-root></app-root>` component, which connects to the root component (`AppComponent`).
   
   - **Example**: This file often includes links to CSS, meta tags, and other resources required to load the app.

### 7. **src/styles.scss** or **src/styles.css** - Global Styles
   - **Purpose**: Contains global styles that apply to the entire application, like fonts, colors, and layout rules.
   
   You can also import styles for libraries or third-party components here.

### 8. **angular.json** - Angular CLI Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration settings for the Angular CLI, such as build options, project settings, and file paths for assets.
   
   - **Example**: It includes the build configuration for your project (e.g., production, development), scripts, and styles that should be included in the build process.

### 9. **package.json** - Project Metadata & Dependencies
   - **Purpose**: Contains metadata about the project (name, version) and all dependencies (both development and production dependencies) required for your project.
   
   - **Scripts**: Defines common tasks like running tests, building the application, or starting the development server.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "angular-app",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "dependencies": {
         "@angular/core": "^12.0.0",
         "rxjs": "^6.5.0"
       }
     }
     ```

### 10. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains the TypeScript compiler options that define how TypeScript files are compiled into JavaScript.
   
   - **Example**: This includes options like module resolution, target JavaScript version, etc.

### 11. **karma.conf.js** - Karma Test Runner Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Configures Karma, which is used to run unit tests. It sets up the testing framework (like Jasmine), the browsers for testing, and test reporters.

### 12. **tslint.json** - Linting Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains rules for linting TypeScript files, which help maintain code quality and ensure that developers follow best practices.
   
   - **Example**: You might have rules for code style, unused variables, or function complexity.

### 13. **webpack.config.js** (Optional)
   - **Purpose**: If you customize the build process, you can include this file to configure how the project is bundled using Webpack.

### Summary

To make it simple, here's how these components work together:
- **src/app/** contains the core functionality and logic of the application (components, services, etc.).
- **src/assets/** holds static files (images, fonts).
- **src/environments/** defines environment-specific configurations.
- **index.html** is the entry point for the app’s HTML structure.
- **angular.json** controls the build and development process for the Angular CLI.
- **package.json** tracks dependencies and project metadata.
- **karma.conf.js** and **tslint.json** help in testing and maintaining code quality.

Each file and folder has its unique role, and together they help in building, managing, and maintaining an Angular application effectively.

## 4. What is a _component_ in Angular and how is it used?
**Answer:**  
A **component** in Angular is a core building block that controls a part of the UI. It consists of three main elements:
- **Template** (HTML): Defines the view (what the user sees).
- **Class** (TypeScript): Contains the logic and data (controller).
- **Styles** (CSS/SCSS): Defines the appearance of the component.

Components are used to create reusable UI elements like buttons, forms, or sections, which can be nested within each other to form the application's structure.

**How it’s used**:  
- Components are declared in **modules**.
- Each component has its own template, logic, and styles.
- Components can be used within other components through **selectors**.

**Summary:**  
A component in Angular is a building block that combines HTML, TypeScript, and CSS to create a UI element, and it is reusable and modular within the app.
<br>

## 5. What are _directives_ in _Angular_ and can you name a few commonly used ones?  
**Directives** in Angular are special markers or instructions in the DOM that modify the appearance, behavior, or layout of elements. They are used to extend HTML’s functionality.  

**Types of Directives:**

1. **Structural Directives**:  
   These change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.  
   - **`*ngIf`**: Conditionally includes a template.
   - **`*ngFor`**: Loops over a collection and repeats the template.

2. **Attribute Directives**:  
   These modify the behavior or appearance of elements.  
   - **`ngClass`**: Dynamically adds or removes CSS classes.
   - **`ngStyle`**: Dynamically changes inline styles.
   - **`[ngModel]`**: Binds an input element to a property, enabling two-way data binding.

**Summary:**  
Directives in Angular modify the DOM’s behavior or appearance, with **structural** ones changing the structure (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and **attribute** ones modifying the element's behavior (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`).
<br>

## 6. How do you create a _service in Angular_ and why would you use one? 
A **service** in Angular is a class that provides specific functionality, such as business logic, data fetching, or utility functions, and can be injected into components or other services. It follows the **single responsibility principle** and promotes **reusability**.

**Creating a Service:**
1. Use Angular CLI to generate a service:  
   ```bash
   ng generate service my-service
   ```
2. In the service class, define methods for the functionality you want to provide:
   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
   
   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root'
   })
   export class MyService {
     getData() {
       return 'Data from service';
     }
   }
   ```

3. Inject the service into a component or another service:
   ```typescript
   constructor(private myService: MyService) { }
   ```

**Why Use a Service?**
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps components focused on UI, leaving logic and data handling to services.
- **Reusability**: Services can be used across multiple components.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes better testability and scalability.

**Summary:**  
Services in Angular encapsulate business logic and data handling. They are created as classes with methods, injected into components, and used for reusability and separation of concerns.
<br>

## 7. Can you explain what _dependency injection_ is in Angular? 
**Dependency Injection (DI)** in Angular is a design pattern that allows objects (or services) to be passed to a class rather than the class creating them itself. This helps with **loose coupling** and makes components, services, and other classes more **testable** and **maintainable**.

Angular’s DI system provides services or objects to components and other services as dependencies. These dependencies are declared in the constructor and automatically injected by Angular.

**How it works:**
1. **Injectable**: A service or class must be marked with the `@Injectable()` decorator to indicate it can be injected.
2. **Providers**: The service is registered with a provider, either globally in the root module or locally within a specific module.
3. **Injection**: Angular automatically injects the service into components or other services via their constructor.

**Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService { }

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html'
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) { }
}
```

**Summary:**  
Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular allows automatic injection of services into components or other services, promoting loose coupling, scalability, and easier testing.
<br>

## 8. What is a _module in Angular_ and what is its purpose? 
A **module** in Angular is a container that groups related components, services, directives, and pipes together. It defines the boundaries of an Angular application or a part of it, making the app modular and maintainable.

**Purpose of a Module:**
1. **Organization**: Modules group related functionality together (e.g., feature modules for specific features, core modules for core functionality).
2. **Dependency Management**: Modules declare dependencies on other modules, ensuring that necessary services and components are available.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Modules can be loaded lazily to improve application performance.
4. **Encapsulation**: Modules provide a way to encapsulate logic and prevent unnecessary dependencies between different parts of the app.

**Root Module (`AppModule`)**: The root module is the entry point of the Angular application and bootstraps the app.

**Example:**
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

**Summary:**  
Modules in Angular group related components, services, and other elements to organize, manage dependencies, and improve maintainability. The root module (`AppModule`) bootstraps the app, while feature modules can be added for specific functionality.
<br>

## 9. How do you handle _events_ in Angular? 
In Angular, events are handled using **event binding**. Event binding allows you to listen to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keypresses) and respond with specific methods in your component class.

**Steps to handle events:**

1. **Event Binding**:  
   Bind the event (like `click`, `change`, etc.) to a method in your component.
   ```html
   <button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
   ```

2. **Define the Event Handler**:  
   In the component class, define the method that will be executed when the event is triggered.
   ```typescript
   export class MyComponent {
     onClick() {
       console.log('Button clicked!');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Passing Data with Events**:  
   You can pass data to the handler by using the `$event` object.
   ```html
   <button (click)="onClick($event)">Click Me</button>
   ```

4. **Event Object**:  
   The `$event` object contains details about the event, such as the target element.
   ```typescript
   onClick(event: MouseEvent) {
     console.log(event.target);
   }
   ```

**Summary:**  
In Angular, events are handled with event binding, where you link an event in the template (e.g., `click`) to a handler method in the component class, optionally passing event data through `$event`.
<br>

## 10. What is _two-way binding_ and how do you implement it in Angular? 
**Two-way data binding** in Angular allows synchronization between the component's data model and the view. Changes in the view are reflected in the model, and changes in the model are reflected in the view.

**How it works:**  
Angular implements two-way binding using the **`ngModel`** directive, which binds a property in the component to an input field in the view, enabling bidirectional communication.

**Steps to implement two-way binding:**

1. **Import FormsModule**:  
   First, import `FormsModule` in the app module to enable two-way binding.
   ```typescript
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
   
   @NgModule({
     imports: [FormsModule],
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

2. **Use `ngModel` in the template**:  
   In the template, bind a form element (e.g., `<input>`) to a component property using `[(ngModel)]`.
   ```html
   <input [(ngModel)]="userName" />
   <p>{{ userName }}</p>
   ```

3. **Update the model**:  
   In the component class, define the `userName` property.
   ```typescript
   export class MyComponent {
     userName: string = '';
   }
   ```

**Summary:**  
Two-way data binding in Angular syncs data between the model and view using `[(ngModel)]`. It ensures changes in the view automatically update the model and vice versa.
