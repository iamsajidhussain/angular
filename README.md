## 🎯 Angular Fundamentals
## 1. What is _Angular_ and what are its key features?  
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building single-page web applications (SPAs). It is maintained by Google and offers a powerful ecosystem for developing dynamic and scalable applications.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Two-way Data Binding**: Synchronizes data between the model and the view.  
2. **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies service management and reusability.  
3. **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular and reusable building blocks.  
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behavior.  
5. **RxJS**: Handles asynchronous operations using reactive programming.  
6. **Routing**: Manages navigation between different views.  
7. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Improves performance by pre-compiling HTML and TypeScript.  

**Summary:**  
Angular is a TypeScript-based framework with features like data binding, dependency injection, components, directives, and reactive programming for scalable SPAs.
<br>

## 2. Explain _data-binding_ in _Angular_. What are the different types?
Data binding in Angular allows synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI). It ensures that changes in data reflect automatically in the UI and vice versa.  

**Types of Data Binding in Angular:**

1. **Interpolation (One-way binding)**:  
   `{{ expression }}`  
   Binds data from the component to the view. Used to display values in HTML.

2. **Property Binding (One-way binding)**:  
   `[property]="expression"`  
   Binds component properties to HTML element properties.

3. **Event Binding (One-way binding)**:  
   `(event)="handler"`  
   Binds events like clicks or keypresses to methods in the component.

4. **Two-Way Binding**:  
   `[(ngModel)]="property"`  
   Combines property and event binding, allowing changes in the UI to update the model and vice versa.  

**Summary:**  
Data binding in Angular synchronizes data between the component and view. It includes interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way binding for dynamic UI updates.
<br>

## 3. Describe the Angular application architecture.  
The architecture of an Angular project is organized into several key files and folders, each serving a specific purpose to structure and manage your application effectively. Below is a detailed explanation of the typical Angular project architecture, along with the uses of each file and folder.

### 1. **src/app** - The Core Application Folder
   - **Purpose**: Contains the main logic of your application, including components, services, and modules.
   
   #### Key files and folders inside `app`:
   
   - **app.component.ts**: The root component of your application. It usually contains the main layout and is the entry point for your application's component tree.
   - **app.module.ts**: The root module that declares and bootstraps the root component (`AppComponent`). It also imports other feature modules and third-party modules.
   - **app-routing.module.ts**: Defines the routing configuration for your app. It maps URLs to components, so the right component is displayed when a user navigates to a certain route.

   #### Folder Structure:
   
   - **components/**: Contains all Angular components for your app. A component consists of a TypeScript file for logic, an HTML file for the template, and a CSS file for styling.
     - **Example**: `header.component.ts`, `footer.component.ts`
   
   - **services/**: Contains all your Angular services. Services are used for logic that needs to be shared across components (e.g., API calls, data manipulation, etc.). They are typically injected into components via Angular's dependency injection system.
     - **Example**: `auth.service.ts`, `user.service.ts`
   
   - **models/**: Stores TypeScript interfaces or classes that define data structures for your app.
     - **Example**: `user.model.ts`, `post.model.ts`
   
   - **pipes/**: Contains custom pipes that transform data in templates (e.g., formatting dates, capitalizing text).
     - **Example**: `date-format.pipe.ts`
   
   - **directives/**: Contains custom directives that modify the behavior of DOM elements.
     - **Example**: `highlight.directive.ts`

### 2. **src/assets** - Static Assets
   - **Purpose**: Contains static files like images, fonts, and other assets used by the application.
   - **Example**: Images, CSS files, etc.
     - `src/assets/logo.png`

### 3. **src/environments** - Environment Settings
   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., development, production). It allows you to easily switch settings for different environments.
   
   #### Files inside:
   - **environment.ts**: Configurations for the development environment.
   - **environment.prod.ts**: Configurations for the production environment (e.g., production API URLs).
   
   These files can include variables like API endpoints, feature flags, etc.

### 4. **e2e** - End-to-End Tests
   - **Purpose**: Contains tests that verify the complete functionality of your application, simulating user interaction and checking if everything works as expected in a real browser.
   - **Files**:
     - **src/app.e2e-spec.ts**: Defines end-to-end tests for the application. It uses a framework like Protractor (or another testing library) to run the tests in the browser.

### 5. **node_modules** - Dependencies
   - **Purpose**: Contains all the third-party libraries and dependencies your project requires, such as Angular itself, RxJS, and other libraries you install via `npm`.
   
   You don't need to modify files here, as this folder is automatically managed by the package manager.

### 6. **src/index.html** - The Main HTML Template
   - **Purpose**: The root HTML file for the Angular application. This is where Angular bootstraps the app by adding the `<app-root></app-root>` component, which connects to the root component (`AppComponent`).
   
   - **Example**: This file often includes links to CSS, meta tags, and other resources required to load the app.

### 7. **src/styles.scss** or **src/styles.css** - Global Styles
   - **Purpose**: Contains global styles that apply to the entire application, like fonts, colors, and layout rules.
   
   You can also import styles for libraries or third-party components here.

### 8. **angular.json** - Angular CLI Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration settings for the Angular CLI, such as build options, project settings, and file paths for assets.
   
   - **Example**: It includes the build configuration for your project (e.g., production, development), scripts, and styles that should be included in the build process.

### 9. **package.json** - Project Metadata & Dependencies
   - **Purpose**: Contains metadata about the project (name, version) and all dependencies (both development and production dependencies) required for your project.
   
   - **Scripts**: Defines common tasks like running tests, building the application, or starting the development server.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "angular-app",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "dependencies": {
         "@angular/core": "^12.0.0",
         "rxjs": "^6.5.0"
       }
     }
     ```

### 10. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains the TypeScript compiler options that define how TypeScript files are compiled into JavaScript.
   
   - **Example**: This includes options like module resolution, target JavaScript version, etc.

### 11. **karma.conf.js** - Karma Test Runner Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Configures Karma, which is used to run unit tests. It sets up the testing framework (like Jasmine), the browsers for testing, and test reporters.

### 12. **tslint.json** - Linting Configuration
   - **Purpose**: Contains rules for linting TypeScript files, which help maintain code quality and ensure that developers follow best practices.
   
   - **Example**: You might have rules for code style, unused variables, or function complexity.

### 13. **webpack.config.js** (Optional)
   - **Purpose**: If you customize the build process, you can include this file to configure how the project is bundled using Webpack.

### Summary

To make it simple, here's how these components work together:
- **src/app/** contains the core functionality and logic of the application (components, services, etc.).
- **src/assets/** holds static files (images, fonts).
- **src/environments/** defines environment-specific configurations.
- **index.html** is the entry point for the app’s HTML structure.
- **angular.json** controls the build and development process for the Angular CLI.
- **package.json** tracks dependencies and project metadata.
- **karma.conf.js** and **tslint.json** help in testing and maintaining code quality.

Each file and folder has its unique role, and together they help in building, managing, and maintaining an Angular application effectively.
<br>

## 4. What is a _component_ in Angular and how is it used?
**Answer:**  
A **component** in Angular is a core building block that controls a part of the UI. It consists of three main elements:
- **Template** (HTML): Defines the view (what the user sees).
- **Class** (TypeScript): Contains the logic and data (controller).
- **Styles** (CSS/SCSS): Defines the appearance of the component.

Components are used to create reusable UI elements like buttons, forms, or sections, which can be nested within each other to form the application's structure.

**How it’s used**:  
- Components are declared in **modules**.
- Each component has its own template, logic, and styles.
- Components can be used within other components through **selectors**.

**Summary:**  
A component in Angular is a building block that combines HTML, TypeScript, and CSS to create a UI element, and it is reusable and modular within the app.
<br>

## 5. What are _directives_ in _Angular_ and can you name a few commonly used ones?  
**Directives** in Angular are special markers or instructions in the DOM that modify the appearance, behavior, or layout of elements. They are used to extend HTML’s functionality.  

**Types of Directives:**

1. **Structural Directives**:  
   These change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.  
   - **`*ngIf`**: Conditionally includes a template.
   - **`*ngFor`**: Loops over a collection and repeats the template.

2. **Attribute Directives**:  
   These modify the behavior or appearance of elements.  
   - **`ngClass`**: Dynamically adds or removes CSS classes.
   - **`ngStyle`**: Dynamically changes inline styles.
   - **`[ngModel]`**: Binds an input element to a property, enabling two-way data binding.

**Summary:**  
Directives in Angular modify the DOM’s behavior or appearance, with **structural** ones changing the structure (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and **attribute** ones modifying the element's behavior (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`).
<br>

## 6. How do you create a _service in Angular_ and why would you use one? 
A **service** in Angular is a class that provides specific functionality, such as business logic, data fetching, or utility functions, and can be injected into components or other services. It follows the **single responsibility principle** and promotes **reusability**.

**Creating a Service:**
1. Use Angular CLI to generate a service:  
   ```bash
   ng generate service my-service
   ```
2. In the service class, define methods for the functionality you want to provide:
   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
   
   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root'
   })
   export class MyService {
     getData() {
       return 'Data from service';
     }
   }
   ```

3. Inject the service into a component or another service:
   ```typescript
   constructor(private myService: MyService) { }
   ```

**Why Use a Service?**
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps components focused on UI, leaving logic and data handling to services.
- **Reusability**: Services can be used across multiple components.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes better testability and scalability.

**Summary:**  
Services in Angular encapsulate business logic and data handling. They are created as classes with methods, injected into components, and used for reusability and separation of concerns.
<br>

## 7. Can you explain what _dependency injection_ is in Angular? 
**Dependency Injection (DI)** in Angular is a design pattern that allows objects (or services) to be passed to a class rather than the class creating them itself. This helps with **loose coupling** and makes components, services, and other classes more **testable** and **maintainable**.

Angular’s DI system provides services or objects to components and other services as dependencies. These dependencies are declared in the constructor and automatically injected by Angular.

**How it works:**
1. **Injectable**: A service or class must be marked with the `@Injectable()` decorator to indicate it can be injected.
2. **Providers**: The service is registered with a provider, either globally in the root module or locally within a specific module.
3. **Injection**: Angular automatically injects the service into components or other services via their constructor.

**Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService { }

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html'
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) { }
}
```

**Summary:**  
Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular allows automatic injection of services into components or other services, promoting loose coupling, scalability, and easier testing.
<br>

## 8. What is a _module in Angular_ and what is its purpose? 
A **module** in Angular is a container that groups related components, services, directives, and pipes together. It defines the boundaries of an Angular application or a part of it, making the app modular and maintainable.

**Purpose of a Module:**
1. **Organization**: Modules group related functionality together (e.g., feature modules for specific features, core modules for core functionality).
2. **Dependency Management**: Modules declare dependencies on other modules, ensuring that necessary services and components are available.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Modules can be loaded lazily to improve application performance.
4. **Encapsulation**: Modules provide a way to encapsulate logic and prevent unnecessary dependencies between different parts of the app.

**Root Module (`AppModule`)**: The root module is the entry point of the Angular application and bootstraps the app.

**Example:**
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

**Summary:**  
Modules in Angular group related components, services, and other elements to organize, manage dependencies, and improve maintainability. The root module (`AppModule`) bootstraps the app, while feature modules can be added for specific functionality.
<br>

## 9. How do you handle _events_ in Angular? 
In Angular, events are handled using **event binding**. Event binding allows you to listen to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keypresses) and respond with specific methods in your component class.

**Steps to handle events:**

1. **Event Binding**:  
   Bind the event (like `click`, `change`, etc.) to a method in your component.
   ```html
   <button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
   ```

2. **Define the Event Handler**:  
   In the component class, define the method that will be executed when the event is triggered.
   ```typescript
   export class MyComponent {
     onClick() {
       console.log('Button clicked!');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Passing Data with Events**:  
   You can pass data to the handler by using the `$event` object.
   ```html
   <button (click)="onClick($event)">Click Me</button>
   ```

4. **Event Object**:  
   The `$event` object contains details about the event, such as the target element.
   ```typescript
   onClick(event: MouseEvent) {
     console.log(event.target);
   }
   ```

**Summary:**  
In Angular, events are handled with event binding, where you link an event in the template (e.g., `click`) to a handler method in the component class, optionally passing event data through `$event`.
<br>

## 10. What is _two-way binding_ and how do you implement it in Angular? 
**Two-way data binding** in Angular allows synchronization between the component's data model and the view. Changes in the view are reflected in the model, and changes in the model are reflected in the view.

**How it works:**  
Angular implements two-way binding using the **`ngModel`** directive, which binds a property in the component to an input field in the view, enabling bidirectional communication.

**Steps to implement two-way binding:**

1. **Import FormsModule**:  
   First, import `FormsModule` in the app module to enable two-way binding.
   ```typescript
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
   
   @NgModule({
     imports: [FormsModule],
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

2. **Use `ngModel` in the template**:  
   In the template, bind a form element (e.g., `<input>`) to a component property using `[(ngModel)]`.
   ```html
   <input [(ngModel)]="userName" />
   <p>{{ userName }}</p>
   ```

3. **Update the model**:  
   In the component class, define the `userName` property.
   ```typescript
   export class MyComponent {
     userName: string = '';
   }
   ```

**Summary:**  
Two-way data binding in Angular syncs data between the model and view using `[(ngModel)]`. It ensures changes in the view automatically update the model and vice versa.
<br>

## 11. Explain the difference between an _Angular component_ and a _directive_.
**Angular components** and **directives** are both building blocks in Angular, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

### **Angular Component:**
1. **Purpose**: A component is used to define a **UI element** and control its behavior, including template (HTML), logic (TypeScript), and styles (CSS).
2. **Has a Template**: A component always has a template that defines the view (UI).
3. **Used to Create UI**: Components are used to create reusable UI elements, like buttons, forms, or entire pages.
4. **Selectors**: Components are identified and used in the template by their **selector** (HTML tag).
   
   ```typescript
   @Component({
     selector: 'app-button',
     templateUrl: './button.component.html'
   })
   ```

### **Angular Directive:**
1. **Purpose**: A directive is used to **modify the behavior or appearance** of elements in the DOM. It doesn't have its own view.
2. **No Template**: Directives do not have templates or styles. They alter the appearance or behavior of the host element they are attached to.
3. **Used to Extend HTML**: Directives add additional functionality to existing elements without changing the overall structure.
4. **Types**: There are two types of directives:
   - **Structural Directives** (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`): Change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
   - **Attribute Directives** (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`): Change the behavior or appearance of an element.

   ```typescript
   @Directive({
     selector: '[appHighlight]'
   })
   ```

### **Summary:**
- **Component**: Defines both the UI and behavior, always has a template, and is used to create reusable UI elements.
- **Directive**: Modifies the behavior or appearance of DOM elements without a template, and can be structural or attribute-based.
<br>

## 12. What are _Pipes in Angular_ and where would you use them?
**Pipes** in Angular are used to **transform data** in the template before displaying it to the user. They are simple functions that take an input, transform it, and return the transformed value. Pipes are ideal for presenting data in a specific format, such as dates, currencies, or custom transformations.

### **Types of Pipes:**
1. **Built-in Pipes**:
   - **`date`**: Formats dates.
   - **`currency`**: Transforms a number into a currency format.
   - **`uppercase` / `lowercase`**: Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.
   - **`json`**: Converts an object to a JSON string for debugging.
   - **`percent`**: Formats a number as a percentage.
   - **`async`**: Unwraps observable values and resolves promises in the template.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p>{{ birthday | date:'shortDate' }}</p>
   ```

2. **Custom Pipes**:  
   You can create custom pipes to handle specific data transformations based on your application's needs.

   Example of a custom pipe:
   ```typescript
   @Pipe({
     name: 'reverse'
   })
   export class ReversePipe implements PipeTransform {
     transform(value: string): string {
       return value.split('').reverse().join('');
     }
   }
   ```

   In the template:
   ```html
   <p>{{ 'Hello' | reverse }}</p> <!-- Outputs: olleH -->
   ```

### **Where to Use Pipes:**
- **Display Data**: When you need to format or transform data in the view.
- **Format Date, Currency, or Text**: For consistent formatting across the app.
- **Data Transformation**: When applying simple transformations to data directly in the template.

### **Summary:**  
Pipes in Angular are used to transform data before displaying it in the view. Built-in pipes handle common tasks like formatting dates or currencies, and custom pipes can be created for specific transformations.
<br>

## 13. How do you handle _form submissions_ in Angular?
In Angular, form submissions are handled using **reactive** or **template-driven** forms. Both approaches allow capturing user input, validating the form, and processing the submission.

### **Template-Driven Forms:**
1. **Create a Form**: Bind the form to a model using `ngModel`.
   ```html
   <form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(myForm)">
     <input type="text" name="username" [(ngModel)]="username" required />
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

2. **Handle Submission**: Define the `onSubmit()` method in the component class to handle the form submission.
   ```typescript
   export class MyComponent {
     username: string = '';

     onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
       console.log(form.value); // Process form data
     }
   }
   ```

### **Reactive Forms:**
1. **Create a Form Group**: Define a `FormGroup` and `FormControl` in the component.
   ```typescript
   import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

   export class MyComponent {
     myForm = new FormGroup({
       username: new FormControl('', [Validators.required])
     });

     onSubmit() {
       console.log(this.myForm.value); // Process form data
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Template for Form**: Bind the form to the template using `formGroup` and `formControlName`.
   ```html
   <form [formGroup]="myForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
     <input formControlName="username" />
     <button type="submit" [disabled]="myForm.invalid">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

### **Summary:**  
In Angular, form submissions are handled using either **template-driven** or **reactive forms**. Template-driven forms bind the form model using `ngModel`, while reactive forms use `FormGroup` and `FormControl`. Both approaches allow form data to be captured and processed on submission.
<br>

## 14. What is _Angular CLI_ and what can it be used for?
**Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a powerful tool for automating and managing various tasks in Angular development. It simplifies the process of creating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. The CLI provides commands to perform common operations, improving productivity and consistency in development.

### **Key Features and Uses of Angular CLI:**
1. **Project Creation**:  
   - `ng new <project-name>`: Initializes a new Angular project with a predefined folder structure.
   
2. **Development Server**:  
   - `ng serve`: Starts a development server and opens the app in the browser, with automatic reloading on changes.

3. **Generating Components, Services, and More**:  
   - `ng generate component <component-name>`: Generates components, directives, services, pipes, modules, etc.
   - `ng g c <component-name>`: A shorthand for generating components.

4. **Building the Application**:  
   - `ng build`: Compiles the application into static files for deployment, optimizing code for production.

5. **Running Tests**:  
   - `ng test`: Runs unit tests using Karma and Jasmine.
   - `ng e2e`: Runs end-to-end tests using Protractor.

6. **Adding Libraries and Dependencies**:  
   - `ng add <library>`: Installs and configures libraries automatically (e.g., Angular Material).

7. **Environment Configuration**:  
   - Supports multiple environments (development, production) and allows configuration changes based on the environment.

8. **Deployment**:  
   - `ng deploy`: Helps with deployment to hosting platforms like Firebase, GitHub Pages, etc.

### **Summary:**  
Angular CLI is a command-line tool for creating, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications. It simplifies common tasks like project setup, generating components, serving the app, running tests, and handling deployments.
<br>

## 15. Describe how to make _HTTP requests_ in Angular using _HttpClient_.
In Angular, HTTP requests can be made using the `HttpClient` module, which provides methods to interact with RESTful APIs and fetch or send data. The `HttpClient` is part of the `@angular/common/http` package and supports various HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

### **Steps to Make HTTP Requests using HttpClient:**

1. **Import HttpClientModule**:
   In your app module, import `HttpClientModule` to enable HTTP services.
   ```typescript
   import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

   @NgModule({
     imports: [HttpClientModule]
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

2. **Inject HttpClient into a Service or Component**:
   Inject `HttpClient` into your service or component to make HTTP requests.
   ```typescript
   import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root',
   })
   export class ApiService {
     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

     getData() {
       return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Making HTTP Requests**:

   - **GET Request**: Fetch data from a server.
     ```typescript
     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
     ```

   - **POST Request**: Send data to the server.
     ```typescript
     const data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
     this.http.post('https://api.example.com/data', data).subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
     ```

   - **PUT Request**: Update existing data on the server.
     ```typescript
     const updatedData = { name: 'John', age: 31 };
     this.http.put('https://api.example.com/data/1', updatedData).subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
     ```

   - **DELETE Request**: Delete data from the server.
     ```typescript
     this.http.delete('https://api.example.com/data/1').subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
     ```

4. **Handling Response & Errors**:
   - **Handling Response**: You can use `subscribe()` to handle the response.
   - **Error Handling**: Use `catchError` for error handling.
     ```typescript
     import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
     import { of } from 'rxjs';

     this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').pipe(
       catchError(error => {
         console.error('Error occurred:', error);
         return of([]);
       })
     ).subscribe(response => {
       console.log(response);
     });
     ```

### **Summary:**  
In Angular, HTTP requests are made using the `HttpClient` module. You import `HttpClientModule` in the app module, inject `HttpClient` into a service or component, and then use methods like `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, and `delete()` to interact with APIs. Handling responses and errors can be done using RxJS operators like `subscribe()` and `catchError`.
